# Alchemy: A Smarter Waste Management System

Team "Phantom Pain" with members- Shaswat Swain, Ankit Jena, Agni Panda

# Topic:
Waste Management

## PROBLEM STATEMENT I :
Lack of an economically accommodating system to curb and manage waste.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT II :
State of the informal garbage collectors in the country.

# The Solution:
Our idea defines an Everyday Waste Control  System gamified by a ‘Credit’ based ideology that will provide just the right push to the people in a country like India to start managing their waste better.
